-----

ACPI stands for «Advanced Configuration and Power Interface».  
It's an open standard for device configuration and power management, co-developed by Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba.

This project is a fork of the official [ACPICA repository](https://github.com/acpica/acpica).  
Its purpose is to be integrated in the [XEOS Operating System](http://www.xs-labs.com/en/projects/xeos/), which aims at a complete ACPI support.
